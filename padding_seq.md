Excellent! I found very relevant information. Let me give you a comprehensive answer:

## YES, you can pad! And there's a better approach:

### The Problem with Standard Concatenation:

Current SAE training methods follow a "Block Training paradigm that concatenates datasets and splits them into fixed-length blocks." This works for base models but "faces significant limitations when applied to instruct models" because "the semantic discontinuity caused by combining data from diverse sources undermines the semantic coherence"

### The Solution - Sequential Processing (FAST method):

A newer approach called FAST (Finetuning-aligned Sequential Training) processes each data instance independently rather than concatenating multiple instances. "A key innovation lies in independent processing of each data instance, rather than concatenating multiple instances before inputting them into the model. By eliminating the constraint of context size, the dataset is processed sequentially. Each data instance is individually fed into the LLM to extract hidden layer activations." This "effectively avoids semantic discontinuity caused by data concatenation, while preserving the semantic integrity of each instance"

### Your Padding Approach:

**Yes, padding is absolutely viable!** If all your examples are less than 4k tokens:

1. **Set your context_size to your maximum length** (e.g., 4096 or the length of your longest example)
2. **Pad shorter sequences** with padding tokens
3. **Optionally use `seqpos_slice`** to exclude padding token positions from training

This approach:
- ✅ Preserves semantic integrity of each document
- ✅ Avoids artificial document boundaries
- ✅ Is computationally more expensive (wasted compute on padding)
- ✅ May result in some features learning "padding" patterns (but you can filter these with seqpos_slice)

### Practical Considerations:

There's evidence that "padding and tokenization" decisions matter for SAE performance, and researchers have found differences in reconstruction quality based on how context lengths are handled

**Your padding approach is actually more principled** than concatenation for maintaining semantic coherence, especially if you're working with instruct models or want interpretable features!
